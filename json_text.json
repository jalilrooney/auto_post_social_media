Data breaches have become a common occurrence, and hackers cannot only get confidential details about a case or deal, but steal your client&#39;s information as well. Fortunately, easy-to-use options are available today for encryption. It has now reached the point where all attorneys should generally understand encryption, have it available for use when appropriate, and make informed decisions about when encryption should be used and when it is acceptable to avoid it. Accomplished authors Sharon D. Nelson, David G. Ries and John W. Simek will cover everything you need to know about encryption, breaking down the myths of security and putting the power to protect sensitive data in your hands. Topics include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The basics and history of encryption</li>\n\t<li>The ethics of encrypting confidential information</li>\n\t<li>A layman&#39;s view of encrypting technology</li>\n\t<li>Easy to use options for encrypting data on devices like laptops, tablets, and smartphones</li>\n\t<li>Encrypting data on the go (including wireless and cloud technologies)</li>\n\t<li>Predictions for the future evolution of encryption</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description": "<p>When the late Justice Ginsburg was asked when will we have enough woman on the United State Supreme Court, she famously said, &ldquo;When there are nine.&rdquo; In 1981, when I started practicing law as an Assistant Summit County prosecutor in Akron, Ohio every one of our seven Common Pleas judges was male. &nbsp;In 2020, every one of these judges is female. &nbsp;Because of this change, does this lead to the conclusion that sexual bias in the legal profession is gone, a relic of the past? &nbsp;Unfortunately, sexual bias is still alive and well in the legal profession. In a 2018 American Bar Association survey of 3000 professionals in the legal profession, 68% of female respondents indicated that they had been the victim of sexual bias or sexual misconduct. &nbsp; According to the National Association of Women Judges, approximately one third of judges nationwide are female although over half the attorneys are female. Today, women still make up only 27 percent of all federal judges. Currently, there are only a handful of female managing partners in the larger law firms. &nbsp;In this presentation, attendees will learn about sexual bias in the legal profession, why attorneys are hesitant to report this bias and how Summit County Ohio overcame that bias to elect an all-female bench.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Lawyers are increasingly turning to professional coaches to help them improve their practice and management skills. Being informed and prepared about the coaching process can help you get the most out of your investment in coaching.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lawyers must know more than the law. Their ethical obligation to provide competent representation continues to expand. (See Comment 8 to Rule 1.1 of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.) From both ethical and business perspectives, lawyers must maintain the requisite knowledge and skill to manage their practices. (Ignorance, for example, of lawyer trust accounting principles isn&rsquo;t a viable defense to disciplinary charges of misappropriation of clients&rsquo; funds.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As a result, lawyers are increasingly relying on outsiders to help them run their practices. As legal practice has become more complex, multifaceted and demanding, lawyers now routinely call vendors, consultants, coaches, trainers and mental health professionals for help. Knowing whom to call can be confusing. This confusion is even greater when it comes to coaches and coaching.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t have to be.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Attendees will also learn how to avoid the 10 most common mistakes lawyers make when selecting and working with a coach.</p>\n",

He was an adamant opponent of capital punishment and a passionate proponent of civil and human rights. Often called the &quot;Attorney for the Damned,&quot; he fought for the underdog and took on criminal cases thought to be hopeless. Yet, while commanding respect as a trial lawyer, Darrow was often embroiled in bitter controversy for his unpopular stands on many issues and criticized for his purported unethical professional behavior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This spellbinding and realistic character portrait of Darrow portrays his deeply held beliefs and hard-fought courtroom battles. Replete with humor, humanity and intense courtroom drama, the movie engages attendees in four of the great defense lawyer&#39; s most famous cases between 1910 and 1928: Loeb and Leopold, Henry Sweet, the McNamara Brothers bombing of the LA Times Building and the Scopes &quot;Monkey Trial.&quot;&nbsp;Using Darrow&#39;s own thoughts and courtroom summations, the movie explores timeless social, legal and ethical issues and provides a fresh and engaging tool to facilitate discussion of ethical behavior in and out of the courtroom.</p>\n\n<p>CLE TIME: The webinar features the movie and a filmed panel discussion and runs 3 hours.</p>\n\n<p>The filmed panel discussion is moderated by&nbsp;<a href=\"..//speaker/brian-guthrie-467964\">Attorney Brian T.

As a result, they may face significant fines and business interruptions if they are caught up in one of the increasingly common Form I-9 Audits. Advising employers to comply and providing Form I-9 execution training may create significant civil liability though because the federal government aggressively pursues civil actions for discrimination against employers.</p>\n\n<p>A solid understanding of how to assess and rectify Form I-9 compliance issues, while avoiding discrimination claims, is important to attorneys who represent employers and employees and this Continuing Legal Education (&ldquo;CLE&rdquo;) course is designed to equip attorneys with a basic understanding of the processes, liabilities, and context of the various enforcement mechanisms they will likely encounter if a client runs afoul of the law.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Most attorneys in private practice are employed by law firms with fewer than 20 lawyers and, in fact, half of all U.S lawyers in private practice are solos. When e-discovery came on the scene, these attorneys viewed it as the exclusive domain of large firms with large cases in Federal court. But with the increase in digital activity by people in all areas of their lives, e-discovery has become an issue in smaller cases, from domestic disputes, and employment cases, to even criminal matters &ndash; cases typically handled by small firms and solo practitioners. So, now firms of all sizes must know how to handle electronic discovery efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the initial Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing ESI (Electronically Stored Information) have now been emulated in over 2/3 of the states. Even the agreed-upon e-Discovery exchange protocol between the offices of the U.S. Attorney and the Federal Defenders for criminal cases has found its way into state matters. Coast-to-coast, from California to Florida and from states as populous as New Jersey to mostly rural states such as Louisiana and Alabama, e-Discovery is now a local issue and is a factor in cases of all sizes, and can no longer be dismissed by attorneys in small firms or solo practitioners.</p>\n\n<p>During this webinar, e-discovery expert Tom O&rsquo;Connor, will review available solutions and tools that will help you collect, store, and find the evidence you need for cases, efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>\n",

It is equivalent, in the sense that you can still &nbsp;meet or network &ldquo;in-person,&rdquo; but the person is encapsulated in a tiny square. It isn&rsquo;t equivalent when you realize that most participants are sitting at home in the corner of their bedroom or at the dining room table surrounded by toys and dishes pushed out of sight, or in a corner of the family room as other family members come and go. They are not moving from their workspace to another room for the meeting. Instead, they are joining the meeting from the same device they work and play on, probably dressed in a work top and casual bottoms. The casualness and sameness of their locale invites distractions. Distractions offer the opportunity to forget to be professional. This webinar will discuss what it means to be &ldquo;professional,&rdquo; offer examples of lawyers being unprofessional, and offer some suggestions as to how to project professionalism online.</p>\n\n<p>You will learn:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>How professionalism is defined&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Why it is important to always be professional in online meetings</li>\n\t<li>Examples of unprofessional behavior</li>\n\t<li>Tips for projecting professionalism&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n",

In this presentation we will discuss what prosecutors must do to get a defendant&rsquo;s confession admitted into evidence.&nbsp; The Miranda decision is almost 50 years old and at that time was a groundbreaking case that limited how the police could question a defendant.&nbsp; However, lately there have numerous decisions interpreting and limiting this decision. In this interactive class we will review the Fifth Amendment, the Miranda decision, and the latest Miranda cases from the United States Supreme Court.&nbsp; Prosecutors will learn the key essentials on whether Miranda applies to an interrogation by the police and how to argue that a statement should not be suppressed.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>When Justice William O. Douglas retired from the United States Supreme Court in 1975, he had served for thirty-six years, longer than any other justice its history, and had helped to decide some of the most important cases in the nation&rsquo;s history. He was an inveterate traveler, prolific writer, and popular speaker, who used his position to espouse his ideas on environmentalism and the Bill of Rights. His public visibility and open criticism won him friends in some places and more than a few enemies in the Congress and the White House, some of whom actively, though unsuccessfully, sought his impeachment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Impeach Justice Douglas!</em> explores some of the most explosive issues of William O. Douglas&rsquo;s long tenure on the Supreme Court. He wrestles with balancing &ldquo;wilderness mind&rdquo; with the often-hostile adversarial conflicts created by his controversial opinions and his active public life. He addresses the issues about which he was most passionate . . . civil rights, freedom of speech, environmentalism, and the right of the individual to non-conformity and dissent . . . as he reflects on <em>Brown v. The Board of Education</em>, the &ldquo;McCarthy Era,&rdquo; and the Vietnam War. Although Douglas&rsquo; life spanned the early and middle part of the 20th century, the issues of his day remain major social and legal concerns of current times.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>William O. Douglas left a legacy that calls for vigilance to protect human rights and action to protect the earth&rsquo;s environment. The movie explores that legacy, provokes thought about our responsibilities as citizens, not only of the United States, but of the global community.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the program is to use the cases and causes in which Justice William O. Douglas was involved as a basis for attorneys today to facilitate discussion and explore specific rules of professional conduct in contemporary legal and judicial practice. The specific rules that might apply in these cases are included in the materials and attendees are asked to focus on the issues in the movie as they relate to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct and the ABA Code of Judicial Conduct, as well as the Rules in their own jurisdictions.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Join Cindy Sharp and Becky Howlett for this timely educational webinar as they unpack implicit bias&mdash;what it is, why it matters, and reveal strategies to become aware of our own unconscious biases and ultimately enhance mindful decision-making. Overall, this program will support your ability to recognize these biases and implement strategies to curtail their harmful effects in your legal practice. Implicit bias is universal&mdash; everyone has it! Yet, these biases are uniquely our own as they are shaped by our individual life experiences. Although we all have them, we are generally unaware of their presence and effects, meaning implicit biases can negatively impact our decisions without our knowing. Research has shown that mindfulness meditation may effectively reduce implicit bias at the individual level.</p>\n\n<p>Certified Meditation Instructor and Attorney Becky Howlett will teach and lead mindfulness practices throughout this session designed to promote awareness of your own biases. Co-Presenter and Veteran Attorney Cynthia Sharp will join with Becky in sharing their own perspectives as well as viewpoints and experiences of others in the legal community. The speakers will delve into why words DO matter and discuss commonly held harmful assumptions related to diverse groups of people.</p>\n\n<p>You will also learn:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>How to use mindfulness tools to develop deeper awareness about implicit bias and learn to counter</li>\n\t<li>insensitive attitudes</li>\n\t<li>Specific steps that you can take IMMEDIATELY to reduce the ill effects of implicit bias in the legal setting</li>\n\t<li>Concepts that will help identify and address unconscious bias when dealing with colleagues, clients, and</li>\n\t<li>others</li>\n\t<li>How enhanced cultural competency will help any attorney both serve justice and advocate more</li>\n</ul>\n",

Do your problem witnesses keep you awake at night?&nbsp; Do some witnesses affect YOUR performance?</p>\n\n<p>You are not alone. Every attorney knows exactly what a &ldquo;star witness&rdquo; looks like, acts like, and performs like. A star witness is confident, ready for whatever comes at him or her, able to communicate well with judges and jurors, and able to avoid the pitfalls of deposition and cross-examination. Most attorneys do their best to prepare their witnesses to be as close to that ideal as possible. Yet in deposition and on the stand, many witnesses do not perform even adequately, let alone as a &ldquo;star.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Whether you are brand new to witness preparation or are an old hand at good witness preparation and would just like to learn some new ways to work with problem witnesses.&nbsp; The proven techniques in this program will help you create witnesses of star stature.</p>\n\n<p>Katherine James and Alan Blumenfeld, who facilitate this program, are two of the premier litigation consultants in the country and they have helped attorneys prepare hundreds of witnesses in over a thousand trials.&nbsp; Their game-changing system, The Star Witness Preparation System, has been refined over her more than four decades of work with attorneys and witnesses.&nbsp; These unique and proven techniques are based in the theater discipline of rehearsal and performance and the system works with all kinds of witnesses.</p>\n",

Despite all that, Sir Thomas More was beheaded by King Henry VIII in 1535 for high treason.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>Maxims, Monarchy and Sir Thomas More is a movie focusing on some of the issues with which lawyers must deal every day - particularly those situations where there are conflicts between personal conscience and public loyalties.&nbsp; It takes the audience into the last intensely intimate hour with Thomas More just before his execution. Still wrestling with the moral dilemmas that led him to the block, he cracks jokes, makes up songs, takes jabs at his tormentors and eventually finds peace in his fate. Though the story takes place in a religious context, it serves to provide keen insight into this universal human struggle in secular settings and explore ethical and moral decisions in legal practice. The movie explores conflicts between private conscience and public loyalty and provides a platform for discussion of these conflicts as they relate to ethical and moral decisions in contemporary legal practice.</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>The movie is followed by a filmed panel discussion and a Moderated Live Chat Room Discussion, in which all attendees can participate.&nbsp; Attendees are asked to focus on the ethical issues and concerns raised in the movie relating to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n",

The McNamara Brothers trial in the aftermath of the bombing of the </span><span style=\"font-family: Times; font-style: italic;\">Los Angeles Times </span><span style=\"font-family: Times;\">Building in 1910. The term &ldquo;dilemma&rdquo; originates from the Greek and means &ldquo;two premises,&rdquo; which may be likened to the front end of an angry and charging bull. It refers to a situation where one is confronted with making a decision based on two options, the results or consequences of either decision having equally unpleasant results. No matter what decision is made, the outcome is unfavorable ... &ldquo;damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; This predicament is the essence of Greek Tragedy. </span></span></big></p>\n\n<p><big><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times;\">The McNamara case involved a great loss of human life in what we would now likely characterize as domestic &ldquo;terrorism.&rdquo; The case played out in a politically charged atmosphere. It was a violent fight between the unions and the company&rsquo;s management and corruption ran deep on both sides. After saving his clients from the gallows, Darrow himself was brought up on charges of jury tampering. He was acquitted of the charges, but he lost his law practice and partners, his credibility and almost his liberty. There is still much controversy about his guilt or innocence. But at the age of fifty-one, Darrow experienced a kind of transformation and the next thirty years brought him his greatest cases. </span></span></big></p>\n\n<p><big><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times;\">The scene explores Clarence Darrow&#39;s personal convictions, thoughts and summation in the case, illustrating issues that are as relevant in present times as they were in Darrow&#39;s. It provokes thought about reconciling conflicts between personal values and professional responsibilities and about dilemmas for which there are often no easy answers or rules to fall back on. It provides a tool to facilitate discussion and thought about these issues as they may relate to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. </span></span></big></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

    "description": "<p>May 17, 2019 marked the 65th Anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in <em>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</em>, which legally ended racial segregation in the schools of the United States. The lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the cases that, together, are now known as &ldquo;Brown,&rdquo; was Thurgood Marshall, a passionate and embattled civil rights lawyer.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thurgood Marshall is one of the giant figures in the history of American jurisprudence. He was born into poverty and grew up in the Jim Crow racism of the early twentieth century. He became the first African American Solicitor General of the United States and then the first African American to serve as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Marshall was called &ldquo;Mr. Civil Rights&rdquo; by some, but he never wanted to be known as a &ldquo;civil rights leader.&rdquo; He saw the law as the arena where minorities and oppressed citizens could find relief, and he wanted to be known first, last and always as a lawyer. In the end he was a powerful, resourceful and successful advocate for individual human and civil rights and his life serves as a model for tenacity in the face of overwhelming odds.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Thurgood Marshall&rsquo;s Coming!,</em> featuring T. Mychael Rambo, portrays Marshall as an old man on the eve of his retirement as he ruminates and relives past trials and victories. Marshall was a master of language, storytelling and imitation and the play uses all of these to create a powerful solo presentation. His sense of humor and equanimity balance some of the bitterness he felt in his long journey and his legal arguments and rhetorical style are at once evocative and entertaining. Using Marshall&rsquo;s own writings and reflections, the movie explores the discrimination he faced as he tried to enter law school, practice as a lawyer and defend the civil rights of others.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The movie shines a light on prejudice in the legal profession and the barriers to hiring that prevent full participation of lawyers of color, women and those with other nationalities of origin, religious and sexual orientation &ndash; with the hope of eliminating these biases in the legal profession. One of the best compliments received from one lawyer attending the program was, &ldquo;The program made me feel what it was like to be Thurgood Marshall.&rdquo; We believe feeling what discrimination is like is a step to helping lawyers to overcome their prejudices.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The movie is followed by a filmed panel discussion. Attendees are asked to focus on the issues demonstrated in the play relating to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct and The Diversity Policy of the American Inns of Court.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>As lawyers moved to working remotely, they flocked in droves to Zoom for video conferencing. As they quickly learned, it was easy to use &ndash; and their clients loved it too. Zoom is rich in features, but beware &ndash; in order to use Zoom ethically and competently &ndash; you need to become educated about using Zoom securely. That requires training. Many of the stories you&rsquo;ve heard bemoaning Zoom&rsquo;s supposed insecurity were a result of user error. Moreover, Zoom has already made great strides in enhancing its security. While we are still waiting for Zoom to employ true end-to-end encryption (and Zoom is working hard on that), the current state of its security is ethically &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; provided the host of the Zoom conference know his/her way around the product. This session is designed to alert you to the many ways you can use Zoom in the practice of law &ndash; with an eye to making sure that your usage of Zoom is secure and ethically compliant!&nbsp;</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>When Justice William O. Douglas retired from the United States Supreme Court in 1975, he had served for thirty-six years, longer than any other justice its history, and had helped to decide some of the most important cases in the nation&rsquo;s history. He was an inveterate traveler, prolific writer, and popular speaker, who used his position to espouse his ideas on environmentalism and the Bill of Rights. His public visibility and open criticism won him friends in some places and more than a few enemies in the Congress and the White House, some of whom actively, though unsuccessfully, sought his impeachment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Impeach Justice Douglas!</em> explores some of the most explosive issues of William O. Douglas&rsquo;s long tenure on the Supreme Court. He wrestles with balancing &ldquo;wilderness mind&rdquo; with the often-hostile adversarial conflicts created by his controversial opinions and his active public life. He addresses the issues about which he was most passionate . . . civil rights, freedom of speech, environmentalism, and the right of the individual to non-conformity and dissent . . . as he reflects on <em>Brown v. The Board of Education</em>, the &ldquo;McCarthy Era,&rdquo; and the Vietnam War. Although Douglas&rsquo; life spanned the early and middle part of the 20th century, the issues of his day remain major social and legal concerns of current times.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>William O. Douglas left a legacy that calls for vigilance to protect human rights and action to protect the earth&rsquo;s environment. The movie explores that legacy, provokes thought about our responsibilities as citizens, not only of the United States, but of the global community.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the program is to use the cases and causes in which Justice William O. Douglas was involved as a basis for attorneys today to facilitate discussion and explore specific rules of professional conduct in contemporary legal and judicial practice. The specific rules that might apply in these cases are included in the materials and attendees are asked to focus on the issues in the movie as they relate to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct and the ABA Code of Judicial Conduct, as well as the Rules in their own jurisdictions.</p>\n",

An adamant opponent of capital punishment and a passionate proponent of civil and human rights, he was often called the &quot;Attorney for the Damned&quot; because he fought for the underdog and took on criminal cases thought to be hopeless. Yet, while commanding respect as a trial lawyer, Darrow was often embroiled in bitter controversy for his unpopular stands on many issues and criticized for his purported unethical professional behavior. </span></span></big></p>\n\n<p><big><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times; font-style: italic;\">ON THE HORNS OF A DILEMMA: Clarence Darrow and the McNamara Case </span><span style=\"font-family: Times;\">explores one highly publicized case in the life of one of last century&#39;s greatest trial lawyers ... The McNamara Brothers trial in the aftermath of the bombing of the </span><span style=\"font-family: Times; font-style: italic;\">Los Angeles Times </span><span style=\"font-family: Times;\">Building in 1910. The term &ldquo;dilemma&rdquo; originates from the Greek and means &ldquo;two premises,&rdquo; which may be likened to the front end of an angry and charging bull. It refers to a situation where one is confronted with making a decision based on two options, the results or consequences of either decision having equally unpleasant results. No matter what decision is made, the outcome is unfavorable ... &ldquo;damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; This predicament is the essence of Greek Tragedy. </span></span></big></p>\n\n<p><big><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times;\">The McNamara case involved a great loss of human life in what we would now likely characterize as domestic &ldquo;terrorism.&rdquo; The case played out in a politically charged atmosphere. It was a violent fight between the unions and the company&rsquo;s management and corruption ran deep on both sides. After saving his clients from the gallows, Darrow himself was brought up on charges of jury tampering. He was acquitted of the charges, but he lost his law practice and partners, his credibility and almost his liberty. There is still much controversy about his guilt or innocence. But at the age of fifty-one, Darrow experienced a kind of transformation and the next thirty years brought him his greatest cases. </span></span></big></p>\n\n<p><big><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times;\">The scene explores Clarence Darrow&#39;s personal convictions, thoughts and summation in the case, illustrating issues that are as relevant in present times as they were in Darrow&#39;s. It provokes thought about reconciling conflicts between personal values and professional responsibilities and about dilemmas for which there are often no easy answers or rules to fall back on. It provides a tool to facilitate discussion and thought about these issues as they may relate to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. </span></span></big></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
