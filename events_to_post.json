      "description": "<p>Join Cindy Sharp and Becky Howlett for this timely educational webinar as they unpack implicit bias&mdash;what it is, why it matters, and reveal strategies to become aware of our own unconscious biases and ultimately enhance mindful decision-making. Overall, this program will support your ability to recognize these biases and implement strategies to curtail their harmful effects in your legal practice. Implicit bias is universal&mdash; everyone has it! Yet, these biases are uniquely our own as they are shaped by our individual life experiences. Although we all have them, we are generally unaware of their presence and effects, meaning implicit biases can negatively impact our decisions without our knowing. Research has shown that mindfulness meditation may effectively reduce implicit bias at the individual level.</p>\n\n<p>Certified Meditation Instructor and Attorney Becky Howlett will teach and lead mindfulness practices throughout this session designed to promote awareness of your own biases. Co-Presenter and Veteran Attorney Cynthia Sharp will join with Becky in sharing their own perspectives as well as viewpoints and experiences of others in the legal community. The speakers will delve into why words DO matter and discuss commonly held harmful assumptions related to diverse groups of people.</p>\n\n<p>You will also learn:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>How to use mindfulness tools to develop deeper awareness about implicit bias and learn to counter</li>\n\t<li>insensitive attitudes</li>\n\t<li>Specific steps that you can take IMMEDIATELY to reduce the ill effects of implicit bias in the legal setting</li>\n\t<li>Concepts that will help identify and address unconscious bias when dealing with colleagues, clients, and</li>\n\t<li>others</li>\n\t<li>How enhanced cultural competency will help any attorney both serve justice and advocate more</li>\n</ul>\n",

There are variants for each venue. Some techniques work better with experts. Those are identified. Most lawyers dread the &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo; and the &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember&rsquo; answers from witnesses, especially at depositions. &nbsp;You will learn practical techniques that will turn these witnesses into your favorite types to cross examine. &nbsp;&ldquo;Trilogies&rdquo; round out this webinar. &nbsp;Trilogies is an ultimate oratorical technique which can be consistently added to cross-examination, as well as to opening statements and closing arguments.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo; Witness</li>\n\t<li>Trilogies</li>\n\t<li>21 Techniques to Control the Difficult Witness in All Three Venues&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "description": "<p>May 17, 2019 marked the 65th Anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in <em>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</em>, which legally ended racial segregation in the schools of the United States. The lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the cases that, together, are now known as &ldquo;Brown,&rdquo; was Thurgood Marshall, a passionate and embattled civil rights lawyer.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thurgood Marshall is one of the giant figures in the history of American jurisprudence. He was born into poverty and grew up in the Jim Crow racism of the early twentieth century. He became the first African American Solicitor General of the United States and then the first African American to serve as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Marshall was called &ldquo;Mr. Civil Rights&rdquo; by some, but he never wanted to be known as a &ldquo;civil rights leader.&rdquo; He saw the law as the arena where minorities and oppressed citizens could find relief, and he wanted to be known first, last and always as a lawyer. In the end he was a powerful, resourceful and successful advocate for individual human and civil rights and his life serves as a model for tenacity in the face of overwhelming odds.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Thurgood Marshall&rsquo;s Coming!,</em> featuring T. Mychael Rambo, portrays Marshall as an old man on the eve of his retirement as he ruminates and relives past trials and victories. Marshall was a master of language, storytelling and imitation and the play uses all of these to create a powerful solo presentation. His sense of humor and equanimity balance some of the bitterness he felt in his long journey and his legal arguments and rhetorical style are at once evocative and entertaining. Using Marshall&rsquo;s own writings and reflections, the movie explores the discrimination he faced as he tried to enter law school, practice as a lawyer and defend the civil rights of others.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The movie shines a light on prejudice in the legal profession and the barriers to hiring that prevent full participation of lawyers of color, women and those with other nationalities of origin, religious and sexual orientation &ndash; with the hope of eliminating these biases in the legal profession. One of the best compliments received from one lawyer attending the program was, &ldquo;The program made me feel what it was like to be Thurgood Marshall.&rdquo; We believe feeling what discrimination is like is a step to helping lawyers to overcome their prejudices.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The movie is followed by a filmed panel discussion. Attendees are asked to focus on the issues demonstrated in the play relating to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct and The Diversity Policy of the American Inns of Court.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>When the late Justice Ginsburg was asked when will we have enough woman on the United State Supreme Court, she famously said, &ldquo;When there are nine.&rdquo; In 1981, when I started practicing law as an Assistant Summit County prosecutor in Akron, Ohio every one of our seven Common Pleas judges was male. &nbsp;In 2020, every one of these judges is female. &nbsp;Because of this change, does this lead to the conclusion that sexual bias in the legal profession is gone, a relic of the past? &nbsp;Unfortunately, sexual bias is still alive and well in the legal profession. In a 2018 American Bar Association survey of 3000 professionals in the legal profession, 68% of female respondents indicated that they had been the victim of sexual bias or sexual misconduct. &nbsp; According to the National Association of Women Judges, approximately one third of judges nationwide are female although over half the attorneys are female. Today, women still make up only 27 percent of all federal judges. Currently, there are only a handful of female managing partners in the larger law firms. &nbsp;In this presentation, attendees will learn about sexual bias in the legal profession, why attorneys are hesitant to report this bias and how Summit County Ohio overcame that bias to elect an all-female bench.</p>\n",

Whether you went to a doctor&rsquo;s office or a lawyer&rsquo;s office, paper ruled the day. But that&rsquo;s changing. One of the last bastions of &ldquo;paper is king&rdquo; is the executed document &ndash; &ldquo;wet&rdquo; signatures serving as proof that a certain person signed a document. This is true&hellip;to a point. Depending on your state, some &ldquo;wet&rdquo; originals govern.</p>\n\n<p>But, for many transactions, digital signatures have the same full legal effect as &ldquo;wet&rdquo; signatures and they&rsquo;re more secure to boot. A digital signature platform produces proof not only of who signed a document, but also when and where, as well as a &ldquo;chain of custody&rdquo; for the document. This seminar explores all things &ldquo;digital signature&rdquo; and starts you down the right path for a digital John Hancock.</p>\n",

The goal of the program is to provide an opportunity for attendees to explore the model of professionalism offered by Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s life and practice and discuss how it provides guidance for contemporary legal practice. The discussion focuses on the issues presented as they might relate to the Preamble and any other relevant portions of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.

Instead of paying for additional service, like Dropbox, use OneDrive to effectively wrangle folders, share documents (and revoke access), save videos and photos, sync locally, and manage different versions.</p>\n",

Plenty of legal organizations subscribe to Microsoft 365 and do so primarily for Word, Excel, and Outlook. But there&#39;s another great benefit to Microsoft 365 - whether you are a solo attorney or a multi-member firm: OneDrive. Every Microsoft 365 subscription includes 1 terabyte (1,000 gigabytes) of cloud storage per user. If you have three employees in the firm, each employee gets 1TB. Instead of paying for additional service, like Dropbox, use OneDrive to effectively wrangle folders, share documents (and revoke access), save videos and photos, sync locally, and manage different versions.</p>\n",
